Projects from CS M10B from Moorpark

Topic A: 
Allocates memory dynamically according to a diagram. Takes in user input to create a two-dimensional array, reverses it, and displays it.

Topic B:
Constructing a Rational class that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers, and print them either as a fraction or a double.

Topic C:
Used operator overloading in Topic B's Rational class instead of functions for arithmetic. 

Topic E:
Draws either a truck or a car using inheritance and polymorphism. Allows the user to name the model of the car and the tonnage for the truck. 

Topic G:
Used the Array class from Chapter 10 of <i>C++: How to Program</i> by Deitel and converts it into a template

Topic I:
Reads data from a file and inputs it into a vector. Then the data is sorted into a deque with the mode calculated, then written to a file.
